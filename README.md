# BOOKING_SYSTEM

Created a booking system for clients that need to dispose certain materials from their building. 

Stacks used:

Frontend: React, JSX, 
Backend: Axios, Node.js
Database/ handling: MYSQL, Prisma.js
Design: UI / Antdesign, CSS

*Responsive design. 

Implementation:
*Write JSX and React components
*Use the useState/useEffect hook in React.
*Call APIs from React and put the data into state.
*Axios and instance handling
*Build multi-page applications using React Router.
*Creating a realational table in mySQL
*Adding deleting, editing and migrating of the mySQL database using Prisma.js
*Scanning and fetching data through prisma features
*Building an organized backend with authentication methods in:
  -JWT Token
  -Bearer Token
  -Token hashing
  -Middlewares
*Working with postman for rigorious backend testing
* Frontend setup with Antdesign. Learning to utilize and customise templates and making the userinterface responsive.
* Lastly having attention to details in cleaning the console log out of small red errors and matching the userinterface id names to exactly to the      standard of  backend id's for bug prevention.
*Runing the code lastly to detect/observe the flow of the application

____________

Next step is to add more features and turn JSX into Typescript for bug prevention efficiancy and to turn this into a overall cutting-edge code. =)

Work flow: Database creation => Backend => Frontend


# What I learned

-Planning the project and brainstorming the database interface based on client needs took suprisingly a while. Had to plan the architecture in detail before starting to create the "matching" backend for utilizing the database correctly.
-Learned thorough planning in a team where client interaction and  customer service played a vital role.  
-How to build easily readable, clean and scalable code with attention to detail.
-Creating a work flow for the backend and building it systematically.
-Working with a UI

Configuring the project to your local machine:

-Download mySQL workbench.
-Create a .env file and add a environmental variable called DATABASE_URL and TOKEN_KEY.
-Connect your mySQL connection string with the environmental variable like this:
-DATABASE_URL = (your connection string) and
-TOKEN_KEY = Some type of password

-Open your terminal and make sure you are in the backend folder.
Then run these commands in the terminal in the exact order:
1. ### `npm install`
2. ### `npm prisma-generate` 
3. ### `npm run dev`

Enjoy :)
